**Manuscript Abstract:**

Climate warming has increased permafrost thaw in arctic tundra and extended the duration of annual thaw (number of thaw days) along soil profiles. Predicting the microbial response to permafrost thaw depends largely on knowing how increased annual thaw duration affects the composition of the soil microbiome. Here we determined soil microbiome composition from the annually-thawed surface active layer down through permafrost from two tundra vegetation types at three sites on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. We found regional variations in microbial taxa between sites (~90 km apart) and by tundra vegetation with depth-dependent variations between active layer and permafrost microbiomes associated with changes in soil type and the transition from thawed to permafrost soil. Multi-decadal thaw surveys show that differences in annual thaw duration by depth were significantly positively correlated with dominant taxa in the active layer and negatively correlated with dominant taxa in the permafrost. Microbiome composition within the transition zone was statistically similar to that in the permafrost, indicating that recent decades of intermittent thaw have not yet induced a shift from permafrost to active layer microbes. We suggest that annual thaw duration rather than thaw frequency has a greater impact on the composition of microbial taxa within arctic soils.
